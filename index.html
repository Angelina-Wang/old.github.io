	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I am a second year student at the University of California, Berkeley planning on majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and minoring in Philosophy, with an anticipated graudation of May 2019. I come from sunny San Diego, so I enjoy burritos and the beach, preferably together, but also acceptable separate.</p>
